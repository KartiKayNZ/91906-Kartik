TODO
1. Add a 'Quest' to the top right of the screen that will say somthing like, collect the magic 
    orb to gain powers and kill the enemy. OR the player can pickup the sword which lets the player gain the 
    ability to slash the sword and do the sword attack. 
2. Once a key is collected maybe multiple enemies spawn
    at spawn points. Use the enemy code that Clepto gave you. It could be like search for the key, 
    and you would have to look everywhere maybe somthing like press E to search (dont have to)

3. Could do somthing like the ghost cant see you unless
    you move? And the ghost would be crazy fast aswell. There could be obstaces and spikes

3. Fix the load screen and make it look nicer
4. Try to fix load times because they're very slow
5. Try to add animations for the the 

SHOULD DO
1. Separate enemy and player sprites into their own classes and make an entity class that
    the enemy and player both supersede form
